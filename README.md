This repository contains my solutions to all problem sets for cs50x 2025.
Problem sets are grouped by weeks, as structured in the 10 week course. 
Subjects covered by week are as follows:

  Week 1: C
  Week 2: Arrays
  Week 3: Algorithms
  Week 4: Memory
  Week 5: Data Structures
  Week 6: Python
  Week 7 SQL
  Week 8: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  Week 9: Flask
  Week 10: Final Project

Folders for each problem set include source code provided by cs50c, which includes data files used as input for certain programs. 
For example, dozens of text files are used as idctionaries and keys for the speller program in week 5.
